I’ve built multiple small projects and prototypes, learning about prefabs, animations, physics, and system design along the way. A while ago, I shifted my focus to cybersecurity and AI — areas I’m deeply passionate about and currently exploring in depth.  But recently, I decided to jump back into game dev temporarily — partly because I missed the creative process, and partly because I have a personal reason: I’m building this game with the hope of earning enough to buy a gaming console for my sister's birthday on July 23rd. She’s been wishing for one for a long time, and this felt like the perfect opportunity to make that happen.  After this project, I’m also planning to experiment with Unreal Engine to build a 3D horror game — just for the fun of pushing myself into something new and different.  So while I may not be here in game dev forever, right now I’m fully in — building, learning, and creating with purpose.",My English is not that good so i used Grammarly to make this grammatically correct at least while writing these :cry:,Anonymous
