GAME IDEA
Game Name: BounceBack
Game Genre: 2D Platformer
Description: You're a rubbery blob trying to escape a colorful cartoon factory. But there's a twist — you can't walk. You can only bounce off walls, floors, and obstacles to move forward. Bounce with precision, solve puzzles, and avoid traps as you escape the BounceLab.
Features:
One-button bounce control
Momentum-based wall movement
Puzzle-platformer levels with switches, traps, and moving platforms
Collectibles to unlock new skins or abilities
Gameplay: You play as a round rubber blob that only moves by bouncing. Pressing a button launches you in a direction, and you’ll bounce off any surface — but bounce too fast or the wrong way and you hit a trap! Each level introduces new elements like bounce pads, lasers, doors, or rotating blocks. Your job is to master angles, physics, and timing to escape. Simple to start, hard to master!
Game Engine: Godot (learning it while building this!)
Experience: This is my first game, and I’ve never used Godot before — but I’ve built web apps and done some programming (JS, Python). I’ll be following tutorials and gradually customizing the game with my own features and art.

GAME IDEA
Game name: Super PolySpawn Wars
Game type: Classic 2D Arcade Space Shooter
One-liner: A fast, fun, and retro-inspired space shooter with powerups, bosses, and intense action.
Features:
Classic arcade vibes with cool modern polish
Powerups like speed boosts, triple shots, shields, and health
Boss battles with increasing difficulty
A smooth 30 FPS experience(I guess that's OK)
Parallax scrolling background for that NEXT LEVEL space feel
Score system based on your performance like how many kills
Pause or quit anytime
Temporary invincibility when you take damage (because everyone deserves a second chance)
Gameplay: You control a nimble spaceship in deep space, rotating and firing with precision using real-time trigonometry. Waves of enemies come at you, each one more intense than the last. Powerups keep you alive a bit longer, bosses keep you guessing, and the action never really stops. It’s fast, skill-based, and totally addictive.
Game engine: UNITY
Experience: I’ve been into game development for quite a while now, mainly working with Unity and C#. I’ve built multiple small projects and prototypes, learning about prefabs, animations, physics, and system design along the way. A while ago, I shifted my focus to cybersecurity and AI — areas I’m deeply passionate about and currently exploring in depth.  But recently, I decided to jump back into game dev temporarily — partly because I missed the creative process, and partly because I have a personal reason: I’m building this game with the hope of earning enough to buy a gaming console for my sister's birthday on July 23rd. She’s been wishing for one for a long time, and this felt like the perfect opportunity to make that happen.  After this project, I’m also planning to experiment with Unreal Engine to build a 3D horror game — just for the fun of pushing myself into something new and different.  So while I may not be here in game dev forever, right now I’m fully in — building, learning, and creating with purpose.
Other notes: My English is not that good so i used Grammarly to make this grammatically correct at least while writing these :cry:
