        <h3>1. Plan your Game </h3>
        <p>Choose what kind of game you want to make (puzzle, platformer, fighting, simulation, racing...) Think about the features you want to add, the theme you want your game to have, and what the actual gameplay will be like. </p>
        <p>Pick a game engine to use. If this is your first time, use <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot</a>. If you have prior game dev experience, you can use <a href="https://unity.com/" target="_blank">Unity</a>.</p>
        <p>If you need a start, go to <a href="http://v1.jumpstart.hackclub.com/" target="_blank">Jumpstart V1's website</a> and there is a comprehensive beginner-friendly guide to get you started on making a platformer in Godot.</p>
        <p>Once you have an idea for your game, post a message in the #jumpstart channel with a one-liner for your game, a couple features you want to add, the game engine you will be using, if you've done game dev before, and any other ideas about your game that you have.</p>
        <p>If you are using the Godot platformer starter guide, you can post "i'm using the Godot platformer starter guide to start my game" for your game idea, but still make sure to include a GAME IDEA title. If you participated in Jumpstart V1, you can post your current game state in format of the 10-hour update message below.</p>

        <h3>2. Build your Game</h3>
        <p>Spend 20 hours building a game! Track your time using Hackatime and make regular commits to a Github repository for your game (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H4A74FIEtg" target="_blank">Godot Github setup</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpXxcvS-g3g" target="_blank">Unity Github setup</a>). You can install Godot hackatime <a href="https://github.com/BudzioT/Godot_Super-Wakatime" target="_blank">here</a> and Unity hackatime <a href="https://hackatime.hackclub.com/docs/editors/unity" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
         <p>If you need a start, go to <a href="http://v1.jumpstart.hackclub.com/" target="_blank">Jumpstart V1's website</a> and there are many beginner-friendly guides to get you started on making a platformer in Godot.</p>
        <p>Once you hit 10 hours, you must post a message in the thread of your original game idea post in #jumpstart and send to channel. It must have your Github repository linked, a screen-recording of your gameplay, a list of what features you added, what the most challenging thing was, and what you are planning on adding next. </p>
        <p>Optionally, you can spend 10 more hours (30 hours total) to earn an epic, exclusive Jumpstart stickersheet along with your console!</p>
