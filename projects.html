            <ul>
              <li>PathPilot: You need to give commands to a robot but you can't see what you've already told him to do. At the end you click run and the "code" runs and if it fails (doesn't reach goal, dies, whatever) you need to restart completely</li>
              <li>Zeroed: There is a field of numbers and you can place blocks (like these from tetris) and these blocks reduce these numbers. Your goal is to have all the numbers at 0.</li>
              <li>IDK:  Something goes forward and each time you click it turns 90°. You need to navigate it through a maze with spikes, etc.</li>
              <li>All the names and the gameplay for each game might change. I might remove a game or add more games.</li>

A while ago, I shifted my focus to cybersecurity and AI — areas I’m deeply passionate about and currently exploring in depth.  But recently, I decided to jump back into game dev temporarily — partly because I missed the creative process, and partly because I have a personal reason: I’m building this game with the hope of earning enough to buy a gaming console for my sister's birthday on July 23rd. She’s been wishing for one for a long time, and this felt like the perfect opportunity to make that happen.  After this project, I’m also planning to experiment with Unreal Engine to build a 3D horror game — just for the fun of pushing myself into something new and different.  So while I may not be here in game dev forever, right now I’m fully in — building, learning, and creating with purpose.</p></div><div><p>Gameplay: You control a nimble spaceship in deep space, rotating and firing with precision using real-time trigonometry.
